Ans->To compile a Java program that uses the GraalVM into an executable file, you can use the native-image tool that is included with the GraalVM distribution.

Here is an example of how you can use native-image to compile a Java program into an executable file:

Write your Java program and make sure it compiles and runs correctly.

Install the GraalVM on your system, if you haven't already.

Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the directory where the GraalVM is installed.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Java program is located.

Use the javac command to compile your Java program into class files. For example:
javac Main.java

Use the native-image command to compile the class files into an executable file. For example:

native-image Main

This will create an executable file called main in the current directory. You can then run the executable file by typing ./main.



Ans->TestContainers is a Java library that allows you to run tests in a containerized environment, such as a Docker container. 
The main advantage of using TestContainers is that it allows you to run tests against a real instance of a service, such as a 
database, rather than using a mock or stub.

Testcontainers make the following kinds of tests easier:

Data access layer integration tests: Use a containerized instance of a MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle database to test your data access
layer code for complete compatibility, but without requiring complex setup on developers' machines and safe in the knowledge that
your tests will always start with a known DB state. Any other database type that can be containerized can also be used.

Application integration tests: for running your application in a short-lived test mode with dependencies, such as databases, message queues or web servers.

UI/Acceptance tests: use containerized web browsers, compatible with Selenium, for conducting automated UI tests.
